          <h2>Music In My Life</h2>
<p>It connects. It’s a global phenomenon. It’s music. There is music in every culture, in every nation and it’s a part of people’s daily lives. Throughout history it has been something which has brought joy to people in hard times.</p>

<p>That is what it means to me. Music is a cure for when I’m down, and a joy for my happiest days. It’s part of my life and can express my feelings when my own words are not enough. There’s a song to every feeling I feel and I’ve yet to find them all.</p>

<p>I listen to versatile music but sometimes, I have seasons when I listen to just one particular band or artist. I love Rhythm and Blues, Rap and Pop. My all time favorite is Akon, because I love his voice and his beat cheers me up. When it comes to lyrics, I think for example Sheryl Crow, as she has some touching and down-to-earth songs.</p>

<p>One important thing about music is that it connects people. I have found awesome friends thanks to music. I joined a music website where I found many great friends. There we can share our thoughts about music and life.</p>

<p>Music helps me to relax. Certain songs bring memories which either make me cry or happy. Music inspires me and it can sometimes describe my feelings better than I could ever do with words. I love music. This last part was written while I was listening to ‘It’s Not Over’ by Daughtry.</p>

          <h2>How to Enjoy Music</h2>
          <p>One thing I’ve always wondered was how many listens it takes to “like” an album. There’s always those albums that you fall in love with instantly, but most (for me) I have to listen to a few times to appreciate it as a whole.
            As someone who runs a music curation service, this question was even more important. What if I’m passing on songs simply because I didn’t like it on the first listen? Why do I fall in love with some songs instantly, but some take time? I decided to get to the bottom of this. First, I had to find out why we like music in the first place.
            How music makes us happy</p>
            <p>Biologically, we’re wired to love music. A study found that when listening to your favorite music, your brain starts to release dopamine into the nucleus accumbent, or “reward circuit” of your brain, at peak moments in the song. It feels great.
            But another part of your brain, the caudate nucleus, also plays a part in music appreciation. The difference between the cuadate nucleus and the nucleus acumbent is that the former releases dopamine in anticipation of parts of a song. This normally happens with songs that you are already familiar with. You might experience this anticipatory rush right before the chorus of I Knew You Were Trouble. As the drums start beating faster and faster, you get ready for the drop, and your caudate nucleus is kicking it into gear. You know it’s coming, and so does your brain.
            What happens when we hear new music</p>
            <p>So what happens when we listen to a new song? According to research done at Berkeley, your brain is busy looking for patterns to follow when listening to new music. Jill Suttie writes:
            When people listen to unfamiliar music, their brains process the sounds through memory circuits, searching for recognizable patterns to help them make predictions about where the song is heading.
            This may explain why we’re bad at working and listening to brand new music. I do my best work when listening to something familiar, because my brain already knows the song pretty well.</p>

          <h2>How I Got Into Music</h2>
          <p>Music as a social activity got me into all the different music I engage with and listen to today.</p>

           <p> In high-school my friends and I would discuss new music, on the one hand it was great to be the first to find a new artist and share it with friends, but it was mostly fulfilling to discover new possibilities in music and discuss these with other people. Aside from this, actually listening to music was an addictive practice, some months I listened to over 100 albums. Needless to say, this was a huge activity for me and a primary way I would spend my free time (discovering, reading about, and listening to music.</p>
            
            <p>Further on, I started making music due to two kinds of dissatisfaction: personal and stylistic. I personally felt quite lazy at points in time listening to a gargantuan amount of music and not actually making any, I felt it a responsibility to give back to the community and practice which had given me so much. Stylistically, I felt (and still feel) that only I can make the most personally fulfilling music myself, i.e. I had heard a lot of music and felt that I could make something better.</p>
            
           <p>Nowadays my relationship with music is very social; I make primarily classical music and hip-hop music. Working with others in whatever capacity, whether in experimental music or more traditional hip-hop music, I thrive in working with others and engaging with the personal relationships other musicians have with their music. This mode of working is the current driving force for my own fulfilling musical engagement.</p>
